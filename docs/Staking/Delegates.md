### Delegates

The delegates are the stake holders who have some funds deposited and want to participate in staking.
Therefore the steps for delegating stakes are the following:
  - Create `stake key(s)` for generating the __delegate__'s `reward address(es)` for collecting their `stake rewards`.
  - Create `payment key(s)` for generating the __delegate__'s `payment address(es)` for payments that will participate in stake delegation and also deposititing some funds.
  - Register `stake address` on the blockhain, __with__ key deposit, which is required for participatin in staking and 
  - Create and submit the __stake delegation certificate__ for the selected pool.

#### Create _delegate's_ staking keys and addresses

Stake address, derived from a `stake verification key`, is a simple `reward (account) address` which is not a `payment address` therefore it cannot be used as an output of a transaction.
In the `cardano-cli` they use a CBOR format for preventing it to be added as the input into a transaction.

> Keep in mind, that only the __reward__ addresses and the __base___, __pointer__ and some __script__ (not available yet) addresses can participate in the staking.

First, we need to create the relevant `payment` and `stake` keys and the related addresses for the delegate. The payment address for paying the transactions for sending the `registration certificate` (which is just simply the reward account address in some CBOR encoded format) to the chain.

#### Registering the delegate's staking key on chain

The delegate's staking key needs to be registered in the blockchain, which just need a simple transaction using any payment address.

Keep, in mind that the any stake key registration certificates needs a deposit for the costs of tracking the key and the corresponding reward account. Also, it does not require any witness to register the certificate, but only the witness for the fees from the input of the transaction.

# You need only one singing keys included in fee calculation:
